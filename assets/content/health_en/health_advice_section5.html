<h2>High temperatures / Sun exposure</h2>*break*
<p>High temperatures are expected in Portugal during the period of World Youth Day Lisbon 2023, so as pilgrims are expected to spend several hours in the sun, since the vast majority of activities will take place outdoors, we recommend that you take shelter whenever possible and use sunscreen and a hat.</p>
<p>Prolonged exposure to the sun can result in dehydration, fatigue, heat shock and heat stroke. If any of these occur, you may not be able to enjoy the activities proposed for this unique week.</p>
