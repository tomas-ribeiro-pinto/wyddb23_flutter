<h2>Hydration</h2>*break*
<p>Throughout the month of August, temperatures in Portugal are usually quite high, with thermometers almost always above 30ÂºC. Thus, there are several precautions you should take to ensure hydration.</p>
<p>You should choose light clothes, made of natural fibres, light colours and wear a hat and sunglasses. Tight clothing and lack of air circulation make it difficult for sweat to evaporate from the skin (which lowers the skin temperature). Damp places also make it difficult for sweat to be effective.</p>
<p>During the hottest hours, you should avoid exposure to the sun and seek cool or air-conditioned areas.</p>
<p>Drinking plenty of fluids is one of the main ways to prevent the adverse effects of the heat, because fluids not only help to lower body temperature, but are essential to replace the natural loss of fluids that occurs with sweat, which can be quite high due to high temperatures. You should drink at least 1.5 litres of water a day, avoiding carbonated or sugary drinks.</p>
