<h2>Dear Young people of the Salesian Youth Movement&nbsp;</h2>
<p>let us get up and go together to Lisbon to experience the presence of the Risen Christ in our history and in our lives. Let's hurry to meet Him "alive" and Risen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ awaits us in Lisbon to fill us with His light and with His joy. No one can stand still!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another good news is that you will meet other young people who, like you, live the Salesian Youth Spirituality, and are committed to being salt of the earth and light of the world. You are not alone; and you will confirm this truth in the experience of World Youth Day. As Salesian Youth Movement, we would like to set out together to do something concrete. Yes, with our words and actions, let us build hope together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you in Lisbon where I wait for you!&nbsp;</p>
