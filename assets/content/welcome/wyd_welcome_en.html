<h2>Welcome to the World Youth Day 2023, to Lisbon and Portugal, dear friend and pilgrim of the Salesian Youth Movement!&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We accepted Pope Francis' invitation to come and want to experience this world meeting of youngsters. It's a joy to be able to be together again!&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some time with some challenges, gathering efforts, trusting the service of many and entrusting to Mary, Our Lady of the Visitation, this hurried path that brought us here, we reached our goal: we are back together and celebrating with Don Bosco and Main.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this WYD 2023 we will have the opportunity to bring our lives closer together to create unforgettable moments. The motto of these days can help you live them: &ldquo;Come, live and proclaim&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being here in Lisbon is a blessing that will help you to grow in faith and to be more like Jesus, Salesian style. Make these days a time for going out and meeting to offer the Good News of Jesus and the joy that wells up in your heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this APP you can find a lot of useful information, as well as follow so many moments that are prepared for you. General information and Salesian information to make these days richer. Happy navigation!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very happy to welcome you here in Lisbon. Welcome!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Happy and Holy World Youth Day 2023!&nbsp;</strong></p>
