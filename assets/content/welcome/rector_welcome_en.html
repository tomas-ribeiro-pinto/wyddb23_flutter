<h2>My dear young people, dear friends, <span  class="red">welcome to WYD 2023!</span></h2>
<p>With God's grace, we will live and share precious days. With Willing Hearts, we have all come this far.</p>
<p>WYD speaks about the vitality of the church and our Salesian Youth Movement.</p>
<p>Exhibitions, catechesis, vigils and various testimonies will fill Lisbon, for a few days, with proposals and with life.</p>
<p>For the Salesian Youth Movement (SYM), it is also a convergence of thousands of personal and unique stories of young people from our presences. A Salesian experience to strengthen our Salesian youth spirituality.</p>
<p>For anyone who has participated in past journeys, it is evident the sense of thirst that drives many of our young people, many of you, dear young people.</p>
<p>For a few days, hundreds of thousands of young people will appear with a cross on their necks, with WYD shirts, referencing various movements, with religious slogans;</p>
<p>we will take thousands and thousands of photos, and music will surround us. It will also be a public presence of the faith in all areas, physical and media.</p>
<p>What really matters is that, beyond all this, there remains in all of us a concrete, deep and lasting experience. On the retina and in the "memory of the heart" of many young people, many other memories will remain: the experience of communion, of strength, diversity of the Church; the diversity of charisms; the beauty of the Salesian charism in the Church; the international experience; the faith that goes out into the public square, fully lived and without fear; the call to holiness and the vocational dimension of our lives.</p>
<p>In moments like these, some dimensions of our Salesian educational-pastoral proposal values stand out: belonging, celebration, participation, sending to the mission, life of prayer, commitment, etc. But there is one especially valuable element not to be neglected these days: the personal relationship with Christ. Whether it be talking about "friendship" "following" or "discipleship" the important thing will always be to discover and deepen the my personal adherence to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The proper place of Jesus Christ, that is, where he ought to be, is in the center; a center which it is not made up of rational ideas, but it touches the heart of the person: the deepest affectivity, the center of decisions, the deepest convictions that give consistency to the person. If Christ is my center, my friend, and gives Himself for me; if I am the fruit of his love, so I must ask myself - and ask him - what is the dream that He has for me, what is my vocation, the one that will make me fully happy.</p>
<p>My dear young people, Jesus calls,He calls me, He calls us. Jesus is not a mere slogan, but the Lord from whom I receive an invitation to follow him and to whom I owe a reply. Vocations are diverse-marriage, priesthood, consecrated life, life committed to the Kingdom - ...; but it is necessary to decide, not to stand still, not to live without dreams and ideals.</p>
<p>By following Jesus The Lord, all believers are called to be "pilgrims" and "envoys". We are all pilgrims of the faith, sent to proclaim the Good news, Young evangelizers of other young people. Always walking in motion, in action, like the lives of the apostles.</p>
<p>The world needs you, it needs all of us, and it asks of us all this: we cannot disappoint that request!</p>
